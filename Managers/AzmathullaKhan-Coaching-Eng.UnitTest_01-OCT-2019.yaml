        unit: https://jira.devfactory.com/browse/TBGTM-6775
        coaching: In TBGTM-6775 review found that the test prefix is specific to JUnit 3, while @Test is specific to JUnit 4 and deprecates the former. It could be a good approach to remove this prefix and avoid redundancy. It is recommended to follow the Java naming conventions for method's names and remove the underscore characters. For test methods, the underscores can be replaced with BDD format (Given, When, Then).
