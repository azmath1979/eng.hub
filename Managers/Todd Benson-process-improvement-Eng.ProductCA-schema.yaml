recommendation: 
    eliminate waste: false
    improve quality bar: true
    product agnostic: true
    product specific:
        - product name: Codealike 
    description: Currently IC just links TCs to ACC items, but doesn't indicate in the TC which steps achieve which ACC item.  IC should indicate next to each step what ACC item is achieves and how.  This will improve quality of TCs. 
    effort: 1
    impact: ICs need to be coached on doing this and QB bar changed.
