    description: PCA spend too much time on the transition of Eng Problem tickets from state to state (especially after recent increase of DVU target). Jira is slow, and it takes them a few hours per week to do that.  The simple solution is a decrease amount of states in Eng.Problem to 2-3 - this will save a huge amount of work hours for the company.
