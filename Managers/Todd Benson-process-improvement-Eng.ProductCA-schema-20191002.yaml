    description: For all environment setup and fixing environment issues, IC must use CI CD ticket type, but this is not a perfect match and so IC must use some mental magic to make it work.  So I think it would be better to have another issue type for PCAs to use for these environment issues.  Also, the QBs have too many items in them and I think a QB should have max 3 items in it.  This keeps it simple and more efficient.
