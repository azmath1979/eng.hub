        coaching: 1 EP was created by QA in improper format and linked to E2E. Then it was closed by PCA as invalid one. After some time it was re-opened when QA sent the updated E2E to Failed QB. Then, this EP was enqueued in WQ and sent to QE Review by PCA as already done. It was rejected by QE as improperly formatted and then closed by PCA once again. 3 things are to be improved here - 1. PCA should verify every EP even if he considers issue as already done; 2 - E2E shouldn't contain a bunch of linked EPs (ideally, only 1 E2E should be linked - check my process improvement suggestion); 3 - Failed QB should re-open only 1 EP

        unit: no jira ticket
        coaching: Found that he is inaccurate with logging all his CI CD tasks as jira tickets. Told him that he should create an Eng Problem for every CI CD planned update (link it as a blocker to other tasks in WQ if needed) and ping WQ team to update the WQ
