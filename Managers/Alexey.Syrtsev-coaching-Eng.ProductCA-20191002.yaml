        coaching: He was blocked because of he is sharing 2 products and their combination gives wrong order in WQ Dashboard (because EPs are sorted by project and then by Autorank while his query should be sorted by Autorank only). This RC was identified and (since WQ Dashboard JQL wasn't changed by our proposal) it was decided that he will adapt the query for his needs and will extend his personal dashboard with the adapted queue. It helped him to identify his WQ correctly.
