    description: Title: Blocking communication on E2Es from Feature ICs to AU ICs, after initial mapping of available E2Es to FSs has been done. Problem: AU ICs defocusing (switching between units) even though they have finished the unit, and not having more inputs.  Feature IC issue raised “Today we noticed another issue. It looks like E2Es were updated after they were linked to stories. ”  “So now before starting the ticket we need to check with Ilya that linked E2Es are correct.” Email: “Old E2Es for new FS”. Date: 2019.09.26 Solution: Block this kind of communication, based on VP’s (Ovidiu’s) decision, after providing a viable way on how Feature IC should unblock themselves(something that Feature VPs&SEMs should have done): a) If E2Es are completely correct, great. b) If an E2E is missing something to be fixed, do the test with the rest of the correct part of the E2E, and filling in the gaps (if required at all) on the rest of it to do the test. c) If an E2E is changed, again use the part of the E2E that make sense. d) If an E2E is completely un-applicable any more to the FS, than fall back to the functional part of the description to do the test. i) For all of the FSs missing E2Es or having "broken" E2Es, you can optionally contact the PCA notifying him that there is a missing part, but you shouldn't allow that to block you. The whole point of this change was to workaround the fact that the PCAs doesn't have the capacity to do E2Es at this point in time. We are saying optionally because the PCA should be able to see for a FS when it was implemented and whether he changed the linked E2E after you implemented the FS. ii) But definitely, do not contact AU ICs, as they can't help with anything here. Stop placing them as intermediaries. They can see as much as you can from jira, and if you need to contact the PCA, please do so directly. iii) Once the FS is implemented, if it was a case of a missing or "broken" E2E, the PCA needs to (@David, @Federico, @Gabor, @Ovidiu, @Vitaly, please discuss this with VPoProducts if you believe there is a need) accept the way the test was done, and they need to link an E2E that is fitting the P1 scope. Even though they might link a new E2E, if it is fitting the P1 scope, there should be no difference if you implemented the FS.
