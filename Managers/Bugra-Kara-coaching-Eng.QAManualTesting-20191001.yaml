        coaching: On track for the week with 99% FTAR. A deep dive was performed on T1309192323 and a process improvement has been suggested to avoid this failure occurring again. We want review bot to have a 2-hour delay for ICs to fix minor mistakes.

        unit: https://testrail.devfactory.com//index.php?/tests/view/1308892317#testChange-42025372
        coaching: On track for the week. Good handling of the test process, however with 1 failed unit during the week so far. This unit is still in dispute process for we think the failure is due to the SS limitations of the TE tool. I will provide further updates once our dispute gets reviewed.
