    description:  Deployment CRs are rejected by CAB with the reason that the runbooks are in adequate for a product-agnostic person to execute them.  Back and forth conversations and escalations can be avoided if the runbook template is enhanced to mandate the following information: 1. conditions under which the runbook should be executed  2. Infrastructure and application permissions required to execute the runbook 3. pre-requisite knowledge of the product (links to arch docs/confluence pages) 4. How to health check after executing the runbook.
