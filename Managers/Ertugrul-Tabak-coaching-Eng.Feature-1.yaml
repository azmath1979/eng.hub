        It seems the unplanned additional efforts to create GH repo is required
        and blocking all next tickets. Create an automation to duplicate an
        existing large repo and find a way to modify/rewrite the commits to align
        with the testbed requirements. This testbed creation may also be used in
        other tickets.
