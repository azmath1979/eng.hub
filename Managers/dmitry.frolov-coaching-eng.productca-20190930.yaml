        coaching: container diagram coaching -
          1. Great that previous coaching items were delivered 
          2. Technology should be mentioned for the container and relationships
          3. Connections are all over the place - we need to tidy and straighten them up, 
            please (make them mostly straight line, not all tangled like a web)

        coaching: container diagram coaching - 
          1. make sure description of container describes the role in easy terms
          2. there should be no links to software systems on the container diagram only to containers
          3. The background shape for better understanding
            for anything storage should be the vertical 3d cylinder
            (color grey for 3rd party tools / external / color with SE7 color if your own ) 
          4. Technology should be mentioned for the container and relationships
