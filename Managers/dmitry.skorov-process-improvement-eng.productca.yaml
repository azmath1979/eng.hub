    description: when PSEM is planning a new release one of the most important things for him to do is 
    to ensure blast radius is as small as possible while release scope is as big as possible. Broken E2Es VS CDs matrix can do the trick:
    PSEM will see the "price" of adding this or that ticket to release which would make his planning activities easier. Impact is not 100% because
    some PSEMs have a very small number of tickets in backlog, or have all E2Es fixed etc, but 5-7 PSEM can be affected. The effort looks negligible. 
    effort: 1
    impact: 20%
