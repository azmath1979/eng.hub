        coaching: we need to split the operations-rpms repository into containers to do this work
          we should use https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jUQ1JObixid4syeDHxnqgU8des6nZAQnFxx0U_jBwQM/edit?pli=1#gid=0
          this will allow us to continue defining containers and reolocate artifacts
