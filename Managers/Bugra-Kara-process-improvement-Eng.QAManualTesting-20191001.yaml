    description: "This unit was failed QE review by a bot. IC attached 12 SS for a 13 step TC. Upon noticing her mistake within less than an hour, she fixed the execution, adding the missing SS. Now, since the bot reviews TCs in real-time, this gave IC no room to fix her mistake. My process improvement suggestion here is to have a minimum 2 hours of delay for the bot to review test cases. This should help ICs fix minor problems before their units are submitted for review."
