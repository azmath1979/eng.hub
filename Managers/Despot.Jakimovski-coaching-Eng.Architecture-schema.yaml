        coaching: Even though the P1 requirement is to build a reusable control, and the control is used on multiple screens, as per our playbook rule "Every capability MUST target a single screen.", you need to split 1 FS per screen.

        coaching: Although "should" keyword in TDDs has been missed in reviews in the past, please don't use it in future as we don't want to give the Feature IC the wrong impression that this is optional.

        unit: https://jira.devfactory.com/browse/ARCH-1321
        coaching: In order to provide more help to Feature team, look for the E2Es in  FA to E2E traceability matrix sheet https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LS-MsjIpIxqAKe9RQspmDvfHVszEHKkP-3k-f1LyhVM/edit#gid=1813750944 , even for new functional changes. Since this was Milestone2, they might have created the E2Es in M1.x, at least maybe some of them. This improves the quality of your delivered unit.

        coaching: Spend 25% (4hrs) less time on getting to know the product (reading P2s, various product related docs, apart from P1 and PA doc) in order to push the ticket from FQA Pending -> FQA in Review (create the mapping between P1/AU parts/E2Es and FSs). You can eventually learn the product better and better as you create units for the same product.
