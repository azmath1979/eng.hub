          Pay attention to order of information you want to convey first.
          Important pieces should be the first things we need to put in the document, 
          like not supported technologies should be at the top of the document.

          While putting some text in your report, focus on the value it will bring. 
          Providing a comment like Hadoop is used for Big data is stating the obvious, 
          try to focus the relation of the technology with the product.

          Within the scope of Insight generation, go through your documentation and ensure quality.
