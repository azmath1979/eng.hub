        coaching: !!str PCA transitioned the ticket to "in implementation" and closed that in 58 seconds which definitely doesn't reflect the real work effort. The Work Queue should represent the real status of the PCA focus place to watch the activity better. Once you've started the work it should be transitioned to corresponding state.

That caused the ticket went out of our vision and Eng.Maintenance closed it without actually implementing the work in there. The Order unit was eaten and no work was done at the same time. PCA coached to track such changes too.
