    description: A standardized way to store information during imports regarding the products will save time in searching for the required info. e.g:- Knowledge sharing sessions were stored in different sections for different products and there is no standardized way to locate that information.  As i was trying to find info on the products for Avolin i had to spend lot of time in navigating that info. Defining the structure will greatly reduce the time to search.
