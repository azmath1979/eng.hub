    description: E2E work can be separated in 2 types - create E2E and update E2E. Update E2E is usually an easy task because in vast majority of cases it is about changing description format and providing some minor details while E2E creation is more complicated work which demands product investigation, use-case determination, its execution etc. So, E2E update could be considered as a separate type and Work Queue may allocate more E2E-update items in 'E2E Test' time slot (i.e. we may assume that 1 E2E creation takes the same time as 3-4 E2E updates). It may improve balance between E2Es and Arch doc time distribution.
