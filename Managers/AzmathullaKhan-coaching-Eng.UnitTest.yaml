        coaching: In TBGTM-6775 review found that the test prefix is specific to JUnit 3, while @Test is specific to JUnit 4 and deprecates the former. It could be a good approach to remove this prefix and avoid redundancy. It is recommended to follow the Java naming conventions for method's names and remove the underscore characters. For test methods, the underscores can be replaced with BDD format (Given, When, Then).

        unit: https://jira.devfactory.com/browse/TBGTM-6575
        coaching: In TBGTM-6575 review found that line of code exceeds >120 columns and is to be revised in order to be readable and avoid horizontal scroll. Consider using the 'line-wrapping' technique to format this line of code in multiple shorter lines. Try as much as possible to avoid lines longer than 120 columns, since they're not handled well by many terminals and tools.
