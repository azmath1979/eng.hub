#Istvan Kovacs note 1: highPerformer | averagePerformer | lowPerformer is assumed to be purely matematical split of the ICs meaning top 33%, middle 33% and bottom 33%. This is in no way implying that lowPerformers are bad and need to be terminated.

        coaching: "We have 2 options to fix the customer issue with slightly different results and implications. Fernando wanted to ask customer to choose an option. This would have introduced and unknown amount of waiting time. By questioning Fernando he knows which solution is better and safer from the technical point of view. My coaching was to go ahead with that solution and let PCA decide in code review if it's OK or NOK as we cannot afford to wait for customer response cycle." #<free text coaching>
