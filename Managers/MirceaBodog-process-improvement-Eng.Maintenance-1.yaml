    description: When an XTP session is done for understanding code and modules, the focus must be on the areas where the first 2 defects will be fixed. The Defects must be identified before the session and a solution agreed with the navigator in the session. The XTSession ticket is to be closed with a comment that includes which defects were discussed and what is the agreed fix. Maint playbook will be updated with this approach.
