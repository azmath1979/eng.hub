    Feature Epics stay at "In Implementation", if verification is blocked for some reason.
    After all Feature Stories are verified, Eng.Feature need to return to record milestone
    demonstrations (now E2E demos). If the verification takes some time, we have to de-staff the
    team to another product (or another team), and when things are unblocked, we need to call
    them back. For some cases, it is taking months to recover the state, and the same ICs may
    not be available, the environment may have changed, and it shall consume a significant
    amount of effort to complete the delivery.
    The idea is to complete the work of Eng.Feature at once: Once all Feature Stories are pushed
    forward and merged, continue with milestone completion activities: Record the necessary
    final demonstrations.
    This shall also provide a better visibility about the status of the orders.
  effort: 5
  impact: 30.0
